The following packets leave the user’s computer in some order. 
(i) HTTP GET request for the index page 
(ii) DNS request to resolve the web server’s name to its IP address 
(iii) HTTP GET request for an image object 
(iv) TCP SYN to open a connection to the web server 
Which one of the following is the CORRECT chronological order (earliest in time to latest) of the packets leaving the computer ?
